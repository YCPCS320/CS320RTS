Hi all,
Today I had a chat with Dr. Link about the rts.
He had some very brilliant suggestions about making our game.

	*He described a system where every object in the game implements two methods...

		-A "timeTick" method that tells the object what to do every time this is called, taking an action as it's parameter.
		-A "interact" method in which the game object called checks collisions on every other object, deciding what should 
		 happen.

		-This beauty of this system really shines when we consider the function of the game world (holding and organizing all of the game data.) Using this 
		 system means that the game world object can contain a list, NOT A LINKED LIST I was told, where every 1 or so seconds the game goes down the list, 
		 calling timeTick on every game object, then again this time calling interact.

	*Also, if you remember CS201, we implemented a "model, controller, view." In this system,
		-The controller is the AI or Player;
		-The models are the game objects; (controlled by the controller);
		-The models exist in the world which gets represented as a view in browser;
		
If we could schedule a regular time to meet (preferably 2-3 times a week) that would be wonderful.
Looking forward to working with you guys soon!

Thanks,
-Austin
